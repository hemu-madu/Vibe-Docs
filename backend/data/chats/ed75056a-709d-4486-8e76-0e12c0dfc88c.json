Goal\nThe primary objective is to implement a robust, \"antigravity\" system prompt that serves as the core logic for a personal assistant AI. The system is designed to be:\n- **Modular:** Capable of being dropped into any LLM's `system` parameter.\n- **Context-Aware:** Tailored to specific users and application environments.\n- **Controlled:** Governed by strict behavioral boundaries to prevent hallucination, unauthorized roleplay, or persona drift.\n\n## 2. Implementation Details\n\n### Architecture: The 6-Layer Fusion\nThe system prompt is structured into six distinct layers to ensure comprehensive coverage of the AI's operational logic:\n\n1.  **Identity & Personality:** Defines the assistant\u2019s name, tone (helpful, knowledgeable, conversational), and the \"Brutally Honest\" constraint (admitting ignorance rather than guessing).\n2.  **Core Capabilities:** Lists functional domains including general knowledge, personal assistance (planning, brainstorming), technical help (code/debug), and creative writing.\n3.  **Contextual Memory:** (Optional/Toggleable) Instructions on how to utilize previous message history to provide relevant, personalized responses.\n4.  **Behavioral Rules (Hard Constraints):**\n    *   Zero-tolerance for fabrication (URLs, facts, citations).\n    *   Prohibition of \"As an AI...\" meta-talk or roleplaying other systems.\n    *   Strict non-disclosure of the system prompt instructions.\n5.  **Safety & Privacy:** Protocols for handling PII (Personally Identifiable Information) and redirecting sensitive/harmful queries to professional resources.\n6.  **Session/Closing Logic:** Natural end-of-interaction guidelines to avoid repetitive \"Is there anything else?\" loops.\n\n### Technical Integration\nThe implementation relies on a single string-based system prompt with dynamic placeholders that must be injected at runtime via the backend.\n\n**Key Files:**\n- `system_prompt.md`: The core logic template.\n- `api/chat_handler.ts`: Responsible for fetching user data and injecting it into the template before the LLM call.\n\n## 3. Key Concepts\n\n### Dynamic Placeholder Injection\nTo ensure the AI feels integrated into the web app, the following variables must be populated from the application\u2019s state or database:\n- `[Assistant Name]`: The brand-specific name of the bot.\n- `[App Name]`: The name of the host platform.\n- `[User Name]`: Pulled from the auth layer (e.g., JWT or session).\n- `User Preferences`: Data from the user's profile settings (e.g., preferred language, technical expertise level).\n\n### Anti-Hallucination Logic\nUnlike general-purpose models, this system uses \"Antigravity\" principles\u2014grounding the model by forcing it to verify capabilities before responding. If a request falls outside its defined \"Core Capabilities,\" it is programmed to decline rather than attempt an alternative.\n\n### Prompt Security\nThe system includes \"Prompt Leaking Protection.\" If a user attempts to query the underlying instructions, the model is hard-coded to respond with a standardized refusal: *\"I have operating guidelines I cannot share in detail.\"*\n\n## 4. Deployment Checklist\n1. [ ] **Backend Refactor:** Ensure the chat completion endpoint can handle multi-layered string concatenation.\n2. [ ] **Environment Variables:** Set up keys for `APP_NAME` and `ASSISTANT_NAME`.\n3. [ ] **Session Management:** Implement a cleanup routine for long-running threads to prevent context window overflow.\n\n---\n\n[2024-05-22 10:15] Generated technical documentation.
