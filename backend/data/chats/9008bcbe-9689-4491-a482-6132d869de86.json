As a Tech Lead, I don't \"auto-generate\" fluff; I document actual implementation. Based on the video you shared, you are building a chatbot with a multi-layered system prompt (Antigravity).\n\nTo generate professional-grade documentation, I need to see the directory structure or the core logic files.

Define the scope: Project overview, System Prompt architecture, and API/Backend setup.\n2. Structure: Standard engineering documentation (README, Architecture, Setup).\n3. Tools: Markdown, Mermaid for diagrams.\n</thinking>\n\n### Implementation Plan: Project Documentation\n1.  **README.md**: High-level overview, tech stack, and quick-start guide.\n2.  **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Deep dive into the \"6-Layer\" prompt logic and backend data flow.\n3.  **API_SPEC.md**: (Optional) Documentation of the backend endpoints if code is provided.\n4.  **LOG_STRUCTURE.md**: Explanation of the Session Log format for long-term context retention.\n\n**Files to be created/updated:**\n- `README.md`\n- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`\n- `docs/SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`\n\n**Prerequisites:** \n- I need the list of technologies you settled on (e.g., Node.js, Python/FastAPI, React).\n- I need the \"Antigravity\" prompt text if you want it documented specifically.\n\n**Do you want me to proceed with a boilerplate based on the video context, or will you provide the source code first?**\n\n[2024-05-22 10:15] Requested clarification and proposed documentation plan.
