By capturing both visual actions and verbal explanations, the system automates the tedious process of manual documentation, ensuring that the \"why\" behind actions is captured alongside the \"how.\"\n\n---\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n### 1. Multimedia Recording\nThe application captures synchronized streams of **Screen Video** and **Microphone Audio**. This dual-input approach allows the AI to correlate visual changes on the screen with the user's spoken intent, leading to more accurate and descriptive documentation.\n\n### 2. \"Deep Think\" AI Analysis\nVideoDocs features a real-time visualization of the AI's reasoning process. As the video is processed, users can see the \"Deep Think Analysis\" which shows how the AI is structuring the tutorial, identifying key steps, and extracting relevant context.\n\n### 3. Smart Export System\nRather than just providing text, the system generates a comprehensive **Smart Export**. This is a `.zip` package containing:\n*   A formatted **Markdown (.md)** file containing the structured tutorial.\n*   Extracted **high-resolution screenshots** corresponding to each step in the documentation.\n\n### 4. Cross-Platform Accessibility\n*   **Cross-Browser Support:** Optimized for Chrome, Brave, Edge, and Firefox with built-in code fallbacks for inconsistent browser APIs.\n*   **Responsive & Mobile-Ready:** The UI adapts to different screen sizes. On mobile devices where screen recording is restricted, the app automatically switches to **\"Upload Mode\"** to process pre-recorded videos.\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### Prerequisites\nTo run or develop VideoDocs, the following are required:\n*   **Node.js:** Version 18 or higher.\n*   **API Access:** A valid Google Gemini API Key.\n\n### Installation & Setup\n1.  **Clone the Repository:**\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/your-username/vibedocs.git\n    cd vibedocs\n    ```\n2.  **Install Dependencies:**\n    ```bash\n    npm install\n    ```\n3.  **Environment Configuration:**\n    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and define your API key:\n    ```env\n    VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here\n    ```\n\n### Running the Application\nStart the development server using Vite:\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\nThe application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.\n\n### Testing and Verification\nThe project includes a built-in diagnostic tool to verify environment compatibility. Developers can navigate to `/test` to run a \"Run Diagnostics\" check on:\n*   MediaDevices API\n*   Screen Capture capabilities\n*   Audio Capture capabilities\n*   MediaRecorder support\n\n### Technology Stack\n*   **Framework:** Vite + React\n*   **AI Integration:** Google Gemini SDK (`@google/generative-ai`)\n*   **Animations:** Framer Motion\n*   **Icons:** Lucide React\n*   **File Handling:** JSZip (for export packaging)\n*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (implied by typical Vite/React modern setups)", "chat_history": []}
